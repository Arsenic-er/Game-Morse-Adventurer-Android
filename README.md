**v0.45.0**: Chapters 5–15 and the initial Open Station dashboard are implemented. Chapter 11 listening watch makes silence a bounded operating decision; Chapter 12 storm relay verifies one revision-two fictional drill packet; Chapter 13 night operations completes three scheduled contacts; Chapter 14 final promise closes SORA's fixed account without storing player prose; Chapter 15 ordinary QSO seals the first page and unlocks Open Station goals. All play remains offline and fictional; no real emergency traffic, organization, frequency, free chat, or online ranking is represented.

## About

Game-Morse-Adventurer is a local Windows game prototype for learning and using Morse code in a fictional amateur-radio station. Enter the station to open the receiver and hear live background noise, call CQ with a straight key or automatic paddle, wait for a propagation-dependent fictional response, complete the QSO, and explore conditions across an offline world map.

> The Windows portable is an **unsigned prototype build**; Windows may show an Unknown Publisher or SmartScreen warning. Verify the attached SHA-256 before running it. This repository is **source-available** for public review under a **proprietary** license; the original game code and artwork are not open source.

## Highlights

- Hard-edged dark pixel UI using Fusion Bold Pixel for English, Chinese, and Japanese, plus Press Start 2P for Spanish, German, and Russian.
- English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, and Russian interfaces with a persistent language preference.
- A location-aware Home management center with filter-highlighted station, warehouse, shop, log, achievement, and a new interactive `MORSE CODE` book hotspot that opens practice without leaving the active save.
- Three local save slots with a seven-character uppercase callsign, fixed starting location, swappable equipment, and money.
- Standard Morse timing, fixed 650 Hz sidetone, decoding, rhythm scoring, and straight-key WPM detection.
- Straight-key input with `Space`; adjustable 5–40 WPM automatic paddle input with `Z` for dot and `X` for dash, including continuous hold-to-repeat.
- Independent CW practice for characters, fictional callsigns, straight key, and paddle. Guided, Standard, and Challenge difficulties set listening speed and lesson pass targets; staged curricula unlock one lesson at a time in every mode.
- Callsign reception offers five training filters: All, Japan, United States, China, and Europe. Each specific region has eight game-invented, `SIM`-prefixed targets introduced two per lesson; these are fictional exercise labels, not real callsign allocations or authentic regional-prefix data.
- The callsign region can change only before the current session has any answer input, CW pulse, or settled attempt, and is locked throughout weakness review. Changing region clears the callsign recent-target window without resetting lifetime statistics, weakness weights, formal lesson scoring, unlocks, or the 19-lesson total.
- A deterministic shuffled bag avoids repeats within a round and, when the active lesson pool permits, steers the next prompt away from the four most recent targets; each prompt settles at most once. Practice shows session summaries for attempts, accuracy, rhythm, weak characters, and lesson progress.
- Each lesson now identifies the targets introduced in that lesson and its full review pool. A live mastery card explains the scored block, pass rule, remaining questions, correct answers still needed, and whether the current block can still pass.
- With an active save, lifetime results, curriculum progress, and the callsign-reception region preference persist independently by mode. Practice-record schema v3 safely migrates older saves, defaults missing or invalid regions to All, and filters recent targets to the selected fictional pool; without a selected save, training remains available but records stay session-only.
- The Home `MORSE CODE` book shows the aggregate completed-lesson count and percentage across all 19 lessons, and refreshes immediately when the player returns from practice.
- The practice sidebar now provides a four-mode curriculum overview with each mode's completed lessons, total lessons, and percentage. When the selected mode has recorded weaknesses, a five-question weakness review locks its target pool at session start and draws only from currently unlocked weak targets.
- Weakness review updates lifetime attempts, correct answers, averages, weakness weights, recent targets, and last-practiced time, but is never eligible to advance, reset, or otherwise change the formal lesson, its scored block, or completed-lesson count.
- Each correct review answer removes at most one weakness point from its target, while an incorrect answer still adds one. Multi-character prompts recover the eligible character with the highest current weight, breaking ties by target order. The five-question pool remains fixed; a target that reaches zero leaves the next review pool.
- A player-led fictional QSO loop: the receiver opens automatically, the player calls CQ, propagation determines whether a station responds, and a successful contact continues through callsigns, RST, 73/SK, money, and logging.
- A seven-language first-watch briefing and full/hints/off duty coach teach each QSO stage without revealing the remote callsign during blind copy.
- `AGN K` repeats the same remote station over the same channel without changing propagation, attempts, or rewards; malformed messages retain their decoded text for correction instead of ending the QSO after two errors.
- QSO messages are validated in radio order: remote call, `DE`, player call, `RST`, report, `73`, then `K`; misplaced or missing procedural signs receive a specific correction instead of a false pass.
- Persistent QSO result pages and logbook entries include callsign, region, distance, RST, propagation, equipment, WPM, transmit accuracy, rhythm, repeat-request count, and a line-by-line operating review of accepted, transmitted, rejected, and repeat attempts.
- Every settled QSO now stores a permanent seven-language reward breakdown: 100 base money, +50 for an independent watch, +75 for a P0–P2 weak-signal contact, +20 for a first contact with a region, and +25 for a new distance record. The result page and Home logbook read the same schema-v6 ledger; legacy logs retain their historical totals without retroactive rewards.
- A seven-language achievement archive derives six permanent milestones from durable QSO records and retained logs without granting duplicate rewards. Newly unlocked QSO achievements appear immediately in a non-blocking notification queue.
- Atomic, idempotent money settlement prevents a completed QSO from being rewarded more than once.
- Kerbal-style station progression separates technology points from money: 14 increasingly difficult QSO research projects fund 28 nodes across radio, antenna, signal processing, power, and automation. Implemented nodes unlock store purchases; visible future nodes cannot consume points yet.
- A seven-language station store supports atomic purchases, persistent ownership, and warehouse-only equipment changes.
- The first replacement radio, the fictional MICA-8, costs 800 money and is inspired by open uSDX/uSDR QRP concepts: a 5 W eight-band hardware profile, 20% lower receiver noise, 15% shallower perceived QSB through AGC, and paired idle/TX pixel artwork whose red diode lights only while transmitting. Current gameplay remains fixed at 21.060 MHz CW.
- A single accessory slot supports the 300-money CW-500 audio filter, centered at 650 Hz with a 500 Hz bandwidth and 35% lower receiver noise; the equipped accessory is preserved in QSO logs.
- Station clocks display both the selected station's local time and UTC.
- Deterministic offline propagation based on station location, UTC, and 21.060 MHz.
- Propagation levels affect NPC availability, signal gain, noise, QSB, and small frequency offsets.
- Local Windows x64 portable build; no account or network connection required for gameplay.

## Project status

Version **v0.33.0** replaces the binary CQ format gate with simulated remote copy. Each transmitted call is scored against several valid CQ forms, then combined with callsign identity, order, rhythm, player speed, propagation, and the listening operator's skill. Ten fictional callsigns now use seven experimental operator styles with different preferred speeds, receive skill, patience, procedure strictness, response delay, reply length, and query style. A clear call receives a directed reply; a partial copy may produce `?`, `AGN?`, `QRZ?`, or `QRS?`; a recognizable but unreadable signal may trigger an undirected general CQ, while complete garbage or a terse operator may remain silent. Schema-v6 logs preserve CQ quality, copy score, outcome, operator profile, remote WPM, and query count. The v0.25 active-QSO exit guard and all seven interface languages remain intact. Every accepted `main` revision is packaged as a checksummed Windows x64 portable artifact. The same remote-copy model now also evaluates the player's RST/73 report: a partial copy produces `AGN? K` or `QRS? K`, an unreadable report remains recoverable, and only a copied retry can complete and settle the QSO. In v0.28, five of the ten fictional stations may ask one personality-specific optional question about power, QTH, weather, a fictional name, or a fictional age; the other five preserve the short exchange. `AGN K` repeats the question, `SKIP K` or `73 K` skips it, and schema-v6 logs store only the question, outcome, and repeat count—never the answer text. The completed expression sheets for MORSE, WANG, NOVA, DIEGO, and SORA are archived in the private asset repository only; they are not shipped, loaded, or shown during a radio contact. During report and optional-exchange stages, `QRS K`, `QRS PSE K`, or `PSE QRS K` asks the same station to repeat the same message more slowly, keeps the same propagation and rewards, and stops at 5 WPM. v0.30 adds a versioned, seed-based procedural-operator foundation for a conceptual population of 100,000 fictional operators across JP, US, CN, DE, CH, and FI. It reconstructs profiles on demand and is designed so future saves need only a tiny world header plus encountered-NPC changes, guarantees unique seven-character `SIM` callsigns per seed, and provides `pnpm npc:generate` for explicit preview or streaming export; it is not yet connected to live QSO selection. v0.31 adds an on-air erase gesture: seven continuous identical dots or dashes clear only the current unsent keying buffer; six elements, mixed elements, and character-length pauses do not trigger it. v0.33.0 treats compact word spacing, callsign splits caused by timing, and the standard `PSE K` ending as equivalent valid CQ styles; operator personality and propagation still determine how genuinely corrupted signals are copied.

- v0.33.0 replaces the station credit abstraction with a save-compatible Money account, adds an atomic one-time reward ledger and expands the medal archive to Contact, Expedition, Operation, Equipment, and People. Existing credits migrate 1:1; medals already earned by legacy saves are preserved without retroactive payouts. The implementation-ready `Unfinished Logbook` design now defines the 15-chapter human story, annual real-world-inspired operating calendar, mission DNA, and post-story Open Station mode.
